# How to Submit Work

There are 2 ways that you can submit work in this course:
by email or by pushing into a remote git repository.
If you submit your work via git, you will receive 2 points
extra credit for each lab or assignment that you submit.
However, you should keep in mind that using git requires
extra study. (But it's worth the effort in my opinion if
you expect to do some type of software development in the future.)
See [the optional instructions for setting up Git](https://github.com/csusbdt/centos/blob/master/GIT.md)
if you want to take that path.
