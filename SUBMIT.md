# How to submit work

There are 2 ways that you can submit work in this course:
by email or by pushing into a remote git repository.

Submitting work by email is the simple way to go.
However, if you want to prepare for a career as a software developer or other computer science field,
you should consider learning the Git version control system and
submit your work with it.

Also, if you submit your work via Git, you will receive 2 points
extra credit for each lab and assignment that you submit.
However, you should keep in mind that using Git requires extra study.
See [the optional instructions for setting up Git](https://github.com/csusbdt/201-2013-fall/blob/master/GIT.md)
if you want to submit your work with Git.
